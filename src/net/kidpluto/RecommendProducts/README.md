Recommend Products
==================

Have web site, on which you want to recommend products for people to buy.

Two methods / operations
  * getFriends given person id, returns friends 
  * getProducts given person id, returns products bought
  
Good code examples

Search method from Collections 
  * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List)  
  
Revisiting this post years later I am horrified at the options available in Java to do this work. A quick search shows me why I now love Kotlin.
